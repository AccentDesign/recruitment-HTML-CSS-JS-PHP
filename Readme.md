## Front-End Interview Test

This is a simple front-end and PHP code challenge created to serve two purposes:

1. Show off your skills
2. Give us a better understanding of your skills

## The Task

The programming challenge exists in 2 parts:

- Part A: HTML + CSS
- Part B: PHP + Javascript

### PART A: HTML + CSS

![front-end_visual_screen](front-end_visual_screen.png)

- Create a layout based on the given screen (front-end_visual_screen.png, front-end_visual_screen.xd).
- Style the layout consistently and beautifully, adhering as closely to the design as possible.
- **NOTE:** You are free to use any preprocessor you wish or write raw CSS. Think about utility-based CSS classes to create re-usable code.

### PART B: PHP + Javascript

- Use the supplied serialised PHP data (front-end_data.txt) to display the details of each card, including:
  - Name 
  - Description
  - Time Alive
  - Technology
  - Strength
  - Special Powers
  - Loyalty
- Format the DOB from the data to determine how long they have been alive using days, weeks, months and years.
- Retrieve the formatted data using JavaScript
- Display the formatted data in the HTML + CSS layout created in step A, sticking to the design, placing data where it fits.
- **NOTE:** You are free to use any framework you wish or do it VanillaJS style
