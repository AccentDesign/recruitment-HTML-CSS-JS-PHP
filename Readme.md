Accent Design Front End Technical Test
======================================

Thanks for your interest in the role of front-end web developer at Accent Design. We are looking for an experienced full stack developer with skills in HTML, CSS/SCSS and JavaScript, and with good communication skills, to join our established team developing websites, web-based software systems and mobile apps. The successful candidate will join the team on a full-time basis at our studio in Norwich, UK, or as a remote worker. We are a small team, so you will be be a big part of it. Your voice will be heard and you will be expected to take on jobs outside of your comfort zone.

If you think you are up for it, then we would like you to spend 2-3 hours having a go at our front end technical test...

## Task Requirements & Considerations

The programming challenge is in 2 parts:

- Part A: HTML + CSS
- Part B: PHP + Javascript

### Part A: HTML + CSS

![front-end_visual_screen](front-end_visual_screen.png)

We would like you to:
- Create a layout based on the given screen for which PNG and XD files are included in this repo (front-end_visual_screen.png, front-end_visual_screen.xd). If you don't already have XD, you should, and you can download it for free from adobe.com.
- Style the layout consistently and beautifully, adhering as closely to the design as possible.
- You are free to use any preprocessor you wish or write raw CSS, but we place great importance on using utility-driven CSS classes to create re-usable code, so please show us that you can do this.

### Part B: PHP + JavaScript

– Use PHP to process the supplied serialised data (front-end_data.txt) into a JSON format that can be consumed by JavaScript.
- Use JavaScript to display the details of each card, including:
  - Name 
  - Description
  - Time Alive
  - Technology
  - Strength
  - Special Powers
  - Loyalty
- Format the DOB from the data to determine how long they have been alive using days, weeks, months and years.
- Retrieve the formatted data using JavaScript
- Display the formatted data in the HTML + CSS layout created in step A, sticking to the design, placing data where it fits.
- You are free to use any framework you wish or do it VanillaJS style

## Good to Know

- We don’t expect your submitted code to work in all browsers or to be responsive at this stage (given the time constraints), but it should show that you’ve thought about fallbacks when using newer language features.
- Think about how the CSS you write can be used across other pages on the site.  We build our CSS in a utility-driven way (Google it if you're not familiar with that term), so show us that you can do that too. 
- If you want to use a grid framework to help you out with the base layout, that’s fine.  However, please don’t use a framework to do the majority of your styling though – we want to see an example of your own CSS, not that you can use a CSS framework like Bootstrap.
- Don’t get too hung up on exact colours of text or margins between elements. We'll be looking at the structure of your code more than expecting pixel precision.
- Don’t overcomplicate the JavaScript part of the task.  We just want to see that you know how to write basic JS. 
- We advise spending at least 2-3 hours on the test – if you want to spend more or less time on it, that’s completely up to you.
